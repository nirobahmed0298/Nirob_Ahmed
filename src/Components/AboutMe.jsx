                    Hi, I'm Nirob Ahmed, a passionate Front-End Developer with a strong focus on creating dynamic and responsive web applications. I have hands-on experience in building user-friendly interfaces with HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a seamless and visually appealing user experience.

                    My skills extend to working with React to create interactive, modern web apps, while also integrating back-end functionality using Firebase, MongoDB, and Express. Whether itâ€™s crafting pixel-perfect designs or optimizing performance, I am always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies.

                    I love the challenge of transforming ideas into code and making the web a better place, one component at a time.
